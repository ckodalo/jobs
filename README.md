# jobs

A job creates Pods that run until successful termination (i.e., exit with 0). In contrast, a regular Pod will continually restart regardless of its exit code. Jobs are useful for things you only want to do once, such as database migrations or batch jobs.

* Sequentially: If you need a Job to run more than once, you set completions to how many times you want the Jobâ€™s pod to run. The following code snippet show how this would look like.

* Parallel: Instead of running single Job pods one after the other, you can also make the Job run multiple pods in parallel. You specify how many pods are allowed to run in parallel with the parallelism Job spec property, as shown below.

## Cron Jobs

Job resources run their pods immediately when you create the Job resource. But many batch jobs need to be run at a specific time in the future or repeatedly in the specified interval. In Linux- and UNIX-like operating systems, these jobs are better known as cron jobs
